## **1.Compilation**
The code compiled without errors. The result is in "[build](./build)" folder.
## **2.Implementation**
**2.1 The Model**

I used the model just as the teacher used in class.   
The car's state: [x, y, ψ, v]   
Actuators: [δ, α]   
Update equations:

**2.2 Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration**

First I set the prediction horizon about 2 or 3 seconds.

Second, I set the dt.

As shown in below. The duration (dt) should larger than t (computation plus latency), otherwise the duration 'tt' is not predicted. That's means we don't know what happend in tt section, witch is not safe.
![](imgs/dur.PNG)   
We also know that dt should be as small as possible.
So I set `dt = computation + latency`, but I don't know the computation. To get the computation I add some code in the `main.cpp` to get the time between two `ws.send`. The code is shown in below :
``` c++
auto start = chrono::system_clock::now();
h.onMessage([&mpc,&start](uWS::WebSocket<uWS::SERVER> ws, char *data, size_t length,uWS::OpCode opCode) {

    // bla bla bla .....
    auto end = chrono::system_clock::now();
    auto dur = chrono::duration_cast<chrono::milliseconds>(end - start);
    std::cout<<"computation time: "<< dur.count() <<"  ms"<<std::endl;
    start = end;
}
```
As we know if the `N` is large the `computation + latency` is also large. So `dt` now is related to `N`.

So I just tried some combination.
Finally I set `N`=20 `dt`=0.15.


**2.3 Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing**

Considering the latency, I need the car's future state(when the car get my command), witch I can predict by the kinematic model, to be my initial state for the MPC.

So I convert the car's current state to be a future state. Then I use this future state as initial state.

Then I convert the waypoints and car state to car's coordinate.

After converting the coordinate, I use the `polyfit()` function to get the coefficients of the waypoints.



**2.4 Model Predictive Control with Latency**
As mentioned in 2.3.

## **3.Something Else**
**Reference speed：**
I think the reference speed should not just be a constant number. The reference speed should be small when the curvature is large. I think the speed have some relation with the curvature.    
In this project I just used two speed. If the curvature is large I use the low speed, if the curvature is small I use the high speed.   

The code below shown how I switch the speed:(located in `MPC.cpp` line 137-155)
```c++
double max_kappa = 0;
  for(int front_dis = 0; front_dis<60;front_dis++){
    // calculate curvature: abs(ddy)/(1+dy^2)^3/2
    double kappa = abs((2*coeffs[2]+6*coeffs[3]*front_dis))/
        pow(1 + pow(coeffs[1]+2*coeffs[2]*front_dis+3*coeffs[3]*front_dis*front_dis, 2), 3.0/2);
    if(kappa>max_kappa)
    {max_kappa = kappa;}
  }
  if(max_kappa>=0.02){ref_v = 60*0.44704;}
  else{ref_v = 90*0.44704;}
```



## **4.Simulation**
The video of my simulation is located in `./video/out.mp4`.(Please ignore the watermark in the video, I used a free software to record my screen so you know that.)
